# Asynchronous Microservices with RabbitMQ andÂ Node.js

This repo contains two microservices that perform database negotation and expose public API. The caching microservice related to them (can be found here)[https://github.com/Doesntmeananything/cache-service].

## Description

- `web-service` acts as an entry point and serves an API that accepts HTTP requests
- `processor-service` receives requests through RabbitMQ channels and queries them against the Postgres database, updating it when needed
- microservices are managed by PM2, clustering and restarting them when required.
